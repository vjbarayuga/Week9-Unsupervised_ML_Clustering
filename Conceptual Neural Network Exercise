Notice?
The model is very bad and is not learning the patterns in the dataset, with a testing loss of about 0.5 after several hundred epochs.

Increase the number of neurons in the hidden layer and try changing the activation function to something other than "Linear." 
Model the data? 
Neurons and what activation function allows you to effectively model the data?
3 neurons in the hidden layer with a ReLU activation function models the data, with a testing loss of about 0.29 fairly quickly.

Add more neurons, layers, or change anything you would like - can you model the data so that the testing loss is 0.01 or less? What is the smallest number of neurons and layers you can use that gives a test loss of 0.01 or less?
2 hidden layers, each with 3 neurons, using a ReLU activation function will do this.

Learning rate is?
The learning rate controls how fast the model converges or finds the lowest loss. Smaller learning rates take a very long time to converge, while too large learning rates do not find the optimal solution.
